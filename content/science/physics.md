# Physics: The Engine of Astronomy

Astronomy is the laboratory of Physics. From the orbital mechanics that keep a satellite in place to the nuclear fusion powering the Sun, the universe is governed by a strict set of mathematical rules.

## Celestial Mechanics
Every movement in the night sky is a dance between **Gravity** and **Inertia**. Whether you are tracking a planet through a telescope or calculating the trajectory of a spacecraft, you are using the same laws formulated by Newton and refined by Einstein.

### The Physics of Light
We cannot visit distant stars, so we study their light. By passing starlight through a prism (spectroscopy), physicists can read the "barcode" of a star. This tells us its temperature, its chemical composition, and even how fast it is moving away from us.

> "If you understand the photon, you understand the universe."

## General Relativity & Spacetime
Space is not an empty void; it is a fabric. Physics teaches us that mass tells space how to curve, and space tells mass how to move. This "curvature" is what we perceive as gravity. In our 3D scene, the **Gravity Lens** represents this bending of light and spacetime around a massive object.

### Core Data Artefacts
* **Universal Gravitational Constant ($G$):** $6.674 \times 10^{-11} \text{ m}^3\text{kg}^{-1}\text{s}^{-2}$
* **Speed of Light ($c$):** $299,792,458 \text{ m/s}$
* **The Astronomical Unit (AU):** $149,597,870.7 \text{ km}$
